The first step in our workflow when working on a new project is to fork the canonical repository. This creates a copy of the repository that is specific to your user on GitHub. Everyone that is working on the project has a fork of the repository where they can safely make changes without impacting the main code or other contributor's code.

----
**Action:** Fork this repo!
