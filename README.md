# USGS Data Science tutorial for Git and GitHub workflow

This template repository contains the issues and starting content to teach the DS fork-and-pull style workflow. For the full experience, it requires someone else (listed as @lindsayplatt in these instructions) to review and merge your pull requests. 

## I'm a learner

Go to the repo that matches your username, `USGS-R/gs-gitflows-[username]`, and start with issue #1.

## I'm leading the course

1. Create a new repository based on this template repo using the naming convention `gs-gitflows-[username]` for each participant. These will be considered the canonical repository for each participant.
1. Go to each of these new repositories you just made and star them. This will manually trigger the workflow that creates the necessary GitHub issues to complete the training using GitHub actions.
1. Be prepared to review and merge 3 pull requests per participant (one with their first two commits, one with merge conflicts resolved, one with changes to the `.gitignore` file).
1. The rest of the course, should run automatically.
