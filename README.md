# ds-gitflows-template

This template repository contains the issues and starting content to teach the DS fork-and-pull style workflow. For the full experience, it requires others to be working with you on your repo in order to simulate merge conflicts. 

# If you are a learner

Create a new repository based on this template repo using the naming convention `gs-gitflows-[username]`. This will be considered the canonical repository for the rest of this training. Go to that repo and start with issue #1.

# If you are leading the course

1. Fork the `gs-gitflows-[username]` for each person participating.
1. You will be notified every time they have a PR and will need to approve + merge.
1. There are some issues that must be completed by you in order to illustrate pulling changes from upstream or merge conflict resolutions.
